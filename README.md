Book Recommendation System

The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences. It leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

Key Features:

âœ… Collaborative Filtering â€“ Suggests books based on user behavior and similar reader preferences.

âœ… Content-Based Filtering â€“ Recommends books by analyzing book descriptions, genres, and keywords.

âœ… Hybrid Approach â€“ Combines both methods for more accurate and diverse recommendations.

âœ… Data Processing â€“ Uses Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data cleaning and feature extraction.

âœ… Model Implementation â€“ Utilizes techniques like cosine similarity, TF-IDF, and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for recommendations.

âœ… Web Integration â€“ Can be deployed using Flask or Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.

This project showcases machine learning, NLP, and data analysis skills, making it valuable for AI-driven applications in personalized content recommendations, e-commerce, and digital libraries. ðŸš€ðŸ“š
